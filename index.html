                    <h1>The Board</h1>
                    <p>First and foremost let's give a peak at what the board looks like. You can download a full-resolution version below.</p>
                    <img src="images/riskofthrones_map_small.png" alt="Small Risk of Thrones Map" class="map">
                    <p>Download the high-resolution board as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8-DllFwoZXscnMyTXJvNk1oZzQ/view?usp=sharing">png</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8-DllFwoZXseTJsamF3aWppajQ/view?usp=sharing">pdf</a>.</p>
                    <p>I had mine printed at a local printer's. They wanted it as a pdf, that's why I included it. You'll have to find something to use as tokens, I bought a bunch of plastic circles in a local board game shop (more about this below). Lastly I just used the 'Special Cards' from an old Risk game I had lying around.</p>



                    <h1>Companion App</h1>
                    <p>The first time we played we spend a few hours just dividing the lands. So later I made a simple companion web-app which randomly divides all lands between a number of players. As long as everyone uses the same seed and number of players every device should divide the world the same way, so feel free to send a link of the app to every player's phone. By default the seed is set to the current date.</p>
                    <p>The companion app can be found <a href="companion/">here</a>.</p>



                    <h1>Rules</h1>
                    <p>Although Risk of Thrones uses mostly the same rules as the original Risk game, there are some additions. All rules not mentioned here are kept unchanged, most households will have their own house-rules, and I encourage you using those.</p>
                    <p>A sheet with all custom rules can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QuzX1nsdQnzBMiFesjz8cuc44RaNeqp5e4vN8ug8PQ0/edit#gid=0">here</a>, a detailed information about each section follows.</p>

                    <h2>Attack/Defence</h2>
                    <p>Some rules involve attacking or defending, these were balanced on using 3 attacking dies and 2 to defend.</p>

                    <h2>Lands</h2>
                    <p>At the beginning of each turn you get a number of units based on the amount of lands you control. This number is calculated by: max( 3, floor( #lands / 3 ) ). Some often used values are given in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QuzX1nsdQnzBMiFesjz8cuc44RaNeqp5e4vN8ug8PQ0/edit#gid=0">rules sheet</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Regions</h2>
                    <p>Regions are what were called continents in the original Risk. A region consists of several lands. When you control an entire region you get a bonus, most of the time this will give you a number of units to be distributed over all lands you control. The amount depends on how many lands are in the region and how many neighbours the regions has. However, some regions are too small to get an army bonus and these will get some kind of other bonus. I tried to make the bonuses make sense with the Game of Thrones lore.</p>
                    <p>The custom rules for The Wild and The Nights Watch are quite extensive and have their own section under the regions. In essence all players that lost all their lands become the masters of the White Walkers, so they can continue to play even after they lost.</p>
                    <p>If the wording of these rules aren't clear you can always send me an email and I'll see if I can explain them better.</p>

                    <h2>Tokens</h2>
                    <p>I bought tokens in 3 sizes from a local board-game-parts store. If you're from Belgium check out <a href="http://www.wingames.be/">WinGames</a>, I bought the cheapest 'fiches' of 12mm, 16mm and 22mm. I bought 8 different colours. These were still the most expensive part of the game. The amounts of each are indicated in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QuzX1nsdQnzBMiFesjz8cuc44RaNeqp5e4vN8ug8PQ0/edit#gid=0">rules sheet</a>, as well as the size of the army we make them represent.</p>

                    <h1>Suggestions</h1>
                    <p>If you played on my map and have any suggestions about the layout or rules, please <a href="mailto:pablo.bollansee+RiskOfThrones@gmail.com?Subject=Risk of Thrones Suggestion" target="_top">send me an email</a>. I promise to read everything you send me, and will see if I can use your suggestions to improve the rules. However, remember that everyone has their own house-rules and the rules I propose should never keep you from using your own.</p>
